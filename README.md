* This app is a browser game called Dragon Egg Hunt. It consists of a set of instructions on how to play and the game itself. You are provided a goal of gold to obtain and three different types of dragon eggs to hunt. To hunt for an egg you simply just click on it, it will automatically be hunted/sold for a gold value specific to that dragon egg and added to your total gold. In order to win the game your total gold value must be exactly equal to the gold objective value. If you go over the objective value you bust and lose the game. Over hunting dragon eggs is frowned upon because they are endangered creatures. After a win/loss, the game resets and the values of each dragon egg changes to a different unknown random value.
